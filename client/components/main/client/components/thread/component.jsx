                                    <p>Exactly. Google: gives me $300 of credit no questions asked and tells me what things will cost upfront.</p>
                                    <p>AWS: makes me apply to a program to get credits and if I want to price out anything it's almost a full-blown research effort where I have to dig through documents and cross reference tables between different services and I still probably miss something important. Free tier is opaque enough to frustrate even "use it at small scale and see," because you still have to do the research to see if they are pulling a "your first hit is free but try to scale and WHAM." Oh, but they're customer obsessed, so after much begging and pleading they'll refund half of WHAM, one time.</p>

                            <p>Yeah, that was weird to me also.  It just sounds like YC companies collectively use enough AWS to get some premium tier support.  I assume GCP has something similar, but YC companies don't spend enough there to get it.</p>

                            <p>Amazon started in retail sales where customer service is king, so it naturally has batter customer service philosophy than Google.</p>

                                    <p>My point is that obviously AWS thinks that on average being in YC is going to result in more revenue for them and therefore they prioritize support for YC companies.
